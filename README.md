# TECO TC-201 QC Data Project
## Overview
My first project in solving practical problems. This software is for the use of TECO Diagnostics and them solely. The purpose is to optimize and automate their quality control (QC) process for their TC-201 diagnostics product. It has a simple UI that reads a local text file and generates corresbonding documents (COA and Lab Worksheet) in the documents/ and "failed documents"/ folders.

##Instructions
Detailed instructions are in "code documentation"/"QC Software Protocol.docx" and Pydocs are in the code documentaions folder too.
