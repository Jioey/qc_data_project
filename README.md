# TECO TC-201 QC Data Project
The purpose of this project is to speed up and automate the documentation step of TECO Diagnostic's quality control procedures.
The software has a simple UI where it reads a local text file and generates QC documents (COA and Lab Worksheet) in the documents/ and "failed documents"/ folders.

Detailed instructions are in "code documentation"/"QC Software Protocol.docx" and Pydocs are in the code documentaions folder too.
